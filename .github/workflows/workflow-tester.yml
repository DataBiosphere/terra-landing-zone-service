# Workflow for testing new actions and workflows
#
# Github does not provide a way to run workflows that are not already merged to the
# default branch. Once a workflow that is configured for manual running is merged,
# then when you change it in a branch and execute your changes.
#
# The purpose of this workflow is to be a scratch space for developing workflows.
# Use it to prepare a workflow. When it is ready, you can copy the file to the
# proper name and merge from there.
